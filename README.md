# InnSight

A platform providing competitive insights and price prediction on Airbnb rental properties.

## Introduction
Thanks to the success of Airbnb and other major platforms, the short-term rental industry is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing segments of travel. According to Airbnb, as of Jan 2018, there are more than 4.85M global active listings on Airbnb and more than 1M Airbnb hosts worldwide.

While the vacation rental industry has become one of the most diverse marketplaces, it has also become a competitive marketplaces where hobbyists and professionals are selling a range of inventory side-by-side across the globe. This creates wild changes in supply and demand in local markets everywhere, making staying on top of pricing a really big challenge for Airbnb hosts. Here I am building a platform providing competitive insights and price prediction on Airbnb rental properties, to help Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing strategy.
